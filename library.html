  <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
  <section class="card">
    <h2>Welcome to the Papers Library</h2>
    <p>
      The Papers Library provides carefully designed examination papers that assess not only mathematical knowledge,
      but also understanding, reasoning, and real-life application.
    </p>
    <p>
      This page explains how the papers are structured, how learners are marked, and what is expected in a good response.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- HOW PAPERS ARE SET -->
  <section class="card">
    <h2>How the Papers Are Set</h2>

    <p>
      Each paper is structured to reflect real-world situations that learners can relate to.
      Questions are developed from everyday contexts such as business, farming, transport, community activities, and data interpretation.
    </p>

    <h3>Paper Structure</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Clear instructions at the beginning of each paper</li>
      <li>Scenario-based questions requiring analysis and reasoning</li>
      <li>Progression from guided questions to more open-ended tasks</li>
      <li>Balanced coverage of curriculum topics</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The structure ensures fairness, clarity, and gradual challenge for learners.
    </p>

  <!-- HOW LEARNERS ARE MARKED -->
  <section class="card">
    <h2>How Learners Are Marked</h2>

    <p>
      Marking is based on both the method used and the final answer.
      Learners are rewarded for correct reasoning even if minor errors occur.
    </p>

    <h3>Key Marking Principles</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Correct interpretation of the scenario</li>
      <li>Appropriate selection of mathematical methods</li>
      <li>Logical steps shown clearly</li>
      <li>Accuracy and clarity of final answers</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This approach encourages learners to think critically rather than guess answers.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- IMPORTANT MARKING NOTES -->
  <section class="card">
    <h2>Important Notes on Marking</h2>

    <p>
      Learners should note the following when answering scenario-based papers:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Marks are awarded for working, not only final answers</li>
      <li>Clear explanation improves understanding and scoring</li>
      <li>Units, labels, and correct presentation matter</li>
      <li>Logical reasoning is highly valued</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Even when an answer is incorrect, good reasoning can earn partial marks.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- WHAT EXAMINERS LOOK FOR -->
  <section class="card">
    <h2>What Examiners Look For</h2>

    <p>
      Examiners focus on how well learners understand and apply mathematics.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Ability to break down a problem</li>
      <li>Correct use of mathematical language and symbols</li>
      <li>Connection between the scenario and the solution</li>
      <li>Neat, organized, and readable work</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These skills prepare learners for advanced studies and real-life problem solving.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- FINAL NOTE -->
  <section class="card">
    <h2>Final Note to Learners</h2>

    <p>
      The Papers Library is designed to help you grow in confidence, understanding, and competence.
      Focus on learning how to think mathematically, not just how to get answers.
