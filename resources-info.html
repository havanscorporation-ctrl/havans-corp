  <!-- SCENARIO-BASED MATHEMATICS -->
  <section class="card">
    <h2>Scenario-Based Papers</h2>

    <p>
      Scenario-based papers are designed to assess learners’ ability to apply school knowledge to real-life situations.
      Instead of testing memorization, these assessments focus on reasoning, interpretation, and decision-making.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each paper presents realistic contexts such as business activities, farming, transport, data analysis, budgeting, and community problem-solving.
      Learners are required to analyze information, choose appropriate subject methods, and explain their reasoning clearly.
    </p>

    <h3>Key Features</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Real-life scenarios aligned with learners’ environment</li>
      <li>Integration of multiple topics in one problem</li>
      <li>Emphasis on explanation, reasoning, and justification</li>
      <li>Assessment of higher-order thinking skills</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These papers prepare learners for modern competency-based assessments and equip them with skills needed beyond examinations.
    </p>
